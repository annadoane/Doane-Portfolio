        <p>Hello! I'm Anna Doane, a junior graphic design major at Illinois State University. I’m passionate about using design to communicate ideas in creative and visually impactful ways. Whether it's through digital media, branding, or print design, my goal is to help bring your vision to life.</p>
        <p>In my work, I strive for balance between form and function, always aiming to create designs that are not only visually appealing but also functional and user-centered. I'm inspired by many different aesthetics, I love having diversity in my skills. In my free time, you can find me exploring new design trends, experimenting with new techniques, and collaborating on creative projects. I also have a passion for film, as well as music!</p>
